This script will create a OpenDocument Text out of an XLIFF file.
The texts to translate are stored on <user-field-decl> elements.

Send the OpenDocument Text to the translator.

You can then extract the translations later with odfuserfields and in
principle put them back into the original XLIFF file, but this is an
exercise left to the reader.
