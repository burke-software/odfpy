.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
OpenDocument can be a complete office document in a single XML file\&. The script will take such a document and create a package\&. This is mainly useful as a postprocesser of a program producing XML, such as a stylesheet\&.

.PP
"Inputfile" is assumed to be an OpenDocument file in XML form\&. If there is no inputfile, the program will read from standard input\&. The flag \-s adds correct suffix to the filename according to what mime type is found in the XML file, in cause you don't know already what document type you are packaging\&.

.PP
If output file is not specified output will be to standard out\&.

.PP
Section 2\&.1\&.1 of Open Document Format for Office Applications says that the [content\&.xml] file contains the document content, along with the \fIautomatic styles\fR needed for the document content\&. The [styles\&.xml] file contains all the named styles of a document, along with the \fIautomatic styles\fR needed for the named styles\&. The application doesn't know which automatic style is needed for what, so it puts the same set of automatic styles into both files\&.

.PP
One could assume that the inverse operation would be easier, but OpenOffice\&.org is quite happy to use the same names for two different styles\&. For instance, a style used inside <style:footer> can have the same name as one used inside <office:text> but be a different paragraph style\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
Doesn't handle external data \-\- images and such\&.

.PP
The library used for the parsing of XML expands empty elements from <element/> to <element></element>\&. It should not have an effect on the document parsing\&.
